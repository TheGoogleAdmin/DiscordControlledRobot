# DiscordControlledRobot
A physical robot that can be controlled by discord.

Equipment:
This is the list of equipment I used, however these parts are interchangeable
1. Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB
2. 64gb MicroSD - with raspbian installed.
3. 7inch portable raspberry pi compatible touchscreen monitor
4. CamJam robotics kit (you could source the motors & wheels seperately)
5. Portable phone charger to power the Pi which also powers the monitor
6. 4 x AA batteries to power the motor
7. Portable speaker


I then used a shoebox for the chasis.
